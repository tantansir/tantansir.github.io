Hi! My name is Tan Kaizhen (谭楷蓁). I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [School of Economics and Management](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), with a diverse and multidisciplinary academic background. During my studies in Information Management and Information System, I developed a solid foundation in computer programming, data management, data analysis and machine learning techniques. Additionally, I acquired knowledge in business-related subjects and gained insights into managerial thinking framework.

Intriguingly, I have always had a great passion for cities and human geography. My research has been exploring innovative applications and development of GeoAI and Urban Data Science. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Wei Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/) and Dr. Weihua Huan from [College of Surveying and Geo-Informatics](https://celiang.tongji.edu.cn/english/Home.htm), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) and [Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lsgi/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). As a research assistant, I collaborated on an SCI paper focused on modeling and analyzing urban traffic congestion propagation patterns using spatio-temporal-semantic knowledge graphs, which is planned for publication this year. 

I am also a student researcher at [College of Architecture and Urban Planning (CAUP)](https://caup.tongji.edu.cn/caupen/main.htm), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), mentoring by [Prof Yujia Zhai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yujia-Zhai-15). We mainly focus on the vast data of tourists' recreational experience, as well as the impact of built environment and urban landscape on human behavior. I successfully developed and fine-tuned two artificial intelligence models to process review texts and tourism photos, respectively. We also aim to produce an SCI paper.

My ultimate goal is to become a data scientist who incorporates the boundless capabilities of AI technologies to develop efficient solutions to complex urban and social problems. I aspire to travel to every county in China and every corner of the world, aiming to use AI methods to genuinely improve people's lives and well-being.

Recent Updates
======
In September 2024, I joined the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) at [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) in Singapore, collaborating with a research team specializing in [Intelligent Transportation Solutions](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/research-capabilities/intelligent-transportation-systems). My role centered on an Air Traffic Management project, where I tackled challenges in data modeling, deep learning, and operational optimization under the mentorship of [Dr. Yicheng Zhang](https://zinczhang.github.io/) and [Dr.Sheng Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086165610).

By December 2024, I wrapped up my on-site work in Singapore and returned to China, where I continue to collaborate remotely. This project has since evolved into my graduation thesis, guided by [Dr. Kejie Wei](https://kejiwei.github.io/), Assistant Professor of Operations at Tongji University.

In January 2025, I will begin an AI product manager internship at the [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), focusing on advancing AI applications across diverse scenarios and driving innovative solutions.
