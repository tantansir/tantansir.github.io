Hi! I’m Kaizhen Tan (谭楷蓁). I am currently a master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at **Carnegie Mellon University**. I received my bachelor’s degree in Information Systems from **Tongji University**, where I built a solid foundation in programming, data analysis, and machine learning, complemented by interdisciplinary training in business and organizational systems.

My research interests focus on **Urban AI, Social Sensing, Digital Twins, Spatial Intelligence, and Embodied AI for Urban Environments**. In particular, I am interested in how AI systems can perceive, reason, and interact with the world not only through data but also through space, behavior, and cognition.

Currently, I am focusing on:

(1) Mobility and accessibility of urban infrastructure for people with disabilities

(2) Urban perception and visual aesthetics to inform urban design and regeneration

(3) Large-scale AI-enhanced geospatial analysis of how urban environments and planning shape human behavior

(4) Multimodal urban data fusion for constructing self-evolving digital twins and virtual urban agents for sustainable and equitable cities

(5) Embodied intelligence-friendly urban spaces that coordinate interactions among autonomous vehicles, drones, robots, and pedestrians

(6) Representation and embedding of geographic and spatial knowledge for building urban foundational models

(7) Interpretable and 3D-enhanced VLM spatial reasoning with unified world representation and long-term memory

My research aims to build intelligent systems that are spatially and socially aware, providing computational solutions that make cities more adaptive, inclusive, and human-centric, while addressing complex societal challenges.
