Hi! I’m Kaizhen Tan (谭楷蓁), a master’s student in Artificial Intelligence Systems Management at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University.

With a background in Information Management and Information System from Tongji University, I’ve developed strong technical skills in programming, data analysis, and machine learning, alongside a solid understanding of business and organizational systems.

My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of AI, urban data science, and geospatial analytics. I’m particularly passionate about exploring how data-driven methods and intelligent systems can improve urban life and inform human-centered planning and decision-making.

Ultimately, I aspire to become a data scientist who harnesses the power of AI to address complex urban and social challenges—with the broader goal of enhancing people's well-being through meaningful, real-world impact.

Work / Research Experience
======

AI Product Manager Intern
[Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) | Jan 2025 – Apr 2025
Worked on designing and refining AI solutions across diverse application scenarios. Focused on bridging the gap between technical feasibility and real-world needs by collaborating closely with research and engineering teams to prototype innovative AI-driven products.

Undergraduate Thesis Researcher
Tongji University (in collaboration with [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) Singapore) | Dec 2024 – Jun 2025
Completed my bachelor’s thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Kejie Wei](https://kejiwei.github.io/), based on prior work at A*STAR's Institute for Infocomm Research under the mentorship of [Dr. Yicheng Zhang](https://zinczhang.github.io/) and [Dr.Sheng Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086165610). The project explored Air Traffic Management using deep learning.

Research Assistant (Urban Traffic Modeling)
Tongji University & The Hong Kong Polytechnic University | Apr 2024 – Aug 2024
Collaborated with [Prof. Wei Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/) and Dr. Weihua Huan on an SCI paper examining urban traffic congestion propagation using spatio-temporal-semantic knowledge graphs. Contributed to data processing, model development, and manuscript drafting.

Research Assistant (Urban Computing & Tourist Behavior)
College of Architecture and Urban Planning (CAUP), Tongji University | Jan 2024 – Sep 2024
Supervised by [Prof. Yujia Zhai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yujia-Zhai-15), I led the development of AI models to analyze tourist perception using text reviews and images. This research investigates how built environments influence human behavior and aims to contribute to human-centric urban planning through data-driven methods.

Student Collaborator (Large Language Model)
School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University | Jan 2024 – Apr 2024
Supervised by Prof. Dawei Cheng, I built the training dataset for CFGPT (Chinese Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformer Framework), and contributed as a prompt engineer.
