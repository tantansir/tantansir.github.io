Hi! I’m Kaizhen Tan (谭楷蓁). I am currently a master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at **Carnegie Mellon University**. I received my bachelor’s degree in Information Systems from **Tongji University**, where I built a solid foundation in programming, data analysis, and machine learning, complemented by interdisciplinary training in business and organizational systems.

My research interests focus on **Urban AI, Spatial Intelligence, and embodied AI in urban scenes**. In particular, I am interested in how AI systems can perceive, reason, and interact with the world not only through data but also through space, behavior, and cognition.

Currently, I am focusing on:

(1) Representation and embedding of geographic and spatial knowledge as a foundation for building world models

(2) Embodied urban intelligence with applications in low-altitude planning and navigation

(3) Multimodal urban data fusion for constructing city-scale foundation models and virtual urban agents

(4) Large-scale geospatial data analysis to uncover urban behavioral patterns

(5) Mobility and accessibility in urban infrastructure for people with disabilities

(6) Visual aesthetics in urban perception to inform urban design and regeneration

My research aims to build intelligent systems that are spatially and socially aware, providing computational solutions that make cities more adaptive, inclusive, and human-centric, while addressing complex societal challenges.
