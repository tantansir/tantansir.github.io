Hi! I’m Kaizhen Tan (谭楷蓁), a master’s student in Artificial Intelligence Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Information Management and Information System from Tongji University, where I built a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and machine learning, complemented by interdisciplinary training in business and organizational systems.

Over the past few years, my academic trajectory has increasingly focused on the convergence of AI and spatial thinking. I am particularly interested in the emerging field of Spatial Intelligence, and how it can be applied to understand and enhance urban environments through computational means. 

At the core of my work is a desire to integrate intelligent systems with urban dynamics, building AI models that are not only technically powerful but also spatially and socially aware. I believe that the future of AI lies in its ability to perceive, reason, and interact with the real world—not just through data, but through space, behavior, and cognition.

Ultimately, I aim to become a data scientist and spatial AI researcher who leverages computational tools to solve complex urban and societal challenges, making cities more adaptive, inclusive, and human-centric.

Work / Research Experience
======

**AI Product Manager Intern**  
*[Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) | Jan 2025 – Apr 2025*

Worked on designing and refining AI solutions across diverse application scenarios. Focused on bridging the gap between technical feasibility and real-world needs by collaborating closely with research and engineering teams to prototype innovative AI-driven products.

**Undergraduate Thesis Researcher**  
*Tongji University (in collaboration with ASTAR Singapore) | Dec 2024 – Jun 2025*

Completed my bachelor’s thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Kejie Wei](https://kejiwei.github.io/), based on prior work at ASTAR's Institute for Infocomm Research under the mentorship of [Dr. Yicheng Zhang](https://zinczhang.github.io/) and [Dr. Sheng Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086165610). The project explored Air Traffic Management using deep learning.

**Research Assistant (Urban Traffic Modeling)**  
*Tongji University & The Hong Kong Polytechnic University | Apr 2024 – Aug 2024*

Collaborated with [Prof. Wei Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/) and Dr. Weihua Huan on an SCI paper examining urban traffic congestion propagation using spatio-temporal-semantic knowledge graphs. Contributed to data processing, model development, and manuscript drafting.

**Research Assistant (Urban Computing & Tourist Behavior)**  
*College of Architecture and Urban Planning (CAUP), Tongji University | Jan 2024 – Sep 2024*

Supervised by [Prof. Yujia Zhai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yujia-Zhai-15), I led the development of AI models to analyze tourist perception using text reviews and images. This research investigates how built environments influence human behavior and aims to contribute to human-centric urban planning through data-driven methods.

**Student Collaborator (Large Language Model)**  
*School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University | Jan 2024 – Apr 2024*

Supervised by [Prof. Dawei Cheng](http://cs1.tongji.edu.cn/~dawei/), I built the training dataset for CFGPT (Chinese Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformer Framework), and contributed as a prompt engineer.
